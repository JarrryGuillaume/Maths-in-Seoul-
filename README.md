A quick rewiew of the Optimization Course I did at SNU. 


The problems shown in this serie of Latex document are either drawn from Convex Optimization â€“ Boyd and Vandenberghe or from Large Scale Convex Optimzation by Wotao Yin and Ernest Ryu (my professor). They are drawn from the homwork we had to do every week. 

I completed the average assignement in around eight hours (sometimes more)
