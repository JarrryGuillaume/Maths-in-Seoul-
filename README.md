# Maths-in-Seoul-
A quick rewiew of the Optimization Course and the Machine Learning course I did at SNU. 


## I Optimization: 

The problems shown in this serie of Latex document are either drawn from the classic: Convex Optimization by Boyd and Vandenberghe or from Large Scale Convex Optimzation by Wotao Yin and Ernest Ryu (my professor). As these solutions are not featured in ether of these books and cannot be found online, I'd figure out it could be interesting for the average reader of these textbook to confront ther ideas to mine. 

These solutions are only the product of my own thinking, and there are sometimes more effective and elegant ways to prove the results shown. This is just the result of my humble work during the very challenging courses I did in Seoul. I completed the average assignement in around eight hours (sometimes more) and most of the time under time constraint, therefore there might be small errors or typos. I apologize for them. 

All my acknoledgement and thanks goes to Ernest Ryu for his remarkable teaching skill and the great book he wrote. 


## II Machine Learning: 

Again, here are proved a few results concerning SVM, Bayesian Probability, Gaussian Process, Bayesian optimization, Graph theory and many more interesting result drawn from the classical Machine Learning Theory (ie, not deep-Learning related). 

I thank the teacher of this course for its enriching rewiew of classical learning theory.
